Task: Biomass data

Plant Biomass data for alpine grasslands on Gongga Mountain, China, are archived at link

There are four sites, each with about 20 plots. For each species in each plot, the following are recorded:

height up to ten times (H1-H10)
Biomass (labelled production)
Cover
Find the total biomass per plot, and present the results in a figure.

As far as possible, follow best practice when running the analysis.
